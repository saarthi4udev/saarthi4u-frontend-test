A key highlight of the Bill is its balanced approach to reform. While introducing a more robust and transparent regulatory framework, it **explicitly safeguards the autonomy of Institutions of National Importance**, ensuring that academic freedom and excellence remain intact.

The proposed framework introduces three independent bodies — the **Standards Council**, **Regulatory Council**, and **Accreditation Council** — each operating within its respective mandate. Together, they aim to enhance accountability, consistency, and quality across universities and higher educational institutions.

By reinforcing governance while respecting institutional independence, the Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025 positions higher education as a key driver of national progress. It represents a strategic step toward building globally respected institutions that contribute meaningfully to India’s social, economic, and innovation ecosystems.
